Tweet: @wow712 @FbayareaS @TammyT01 @Hangry4Life @witchyactivist @ewarren This is the reason why UBI by just anyone is not a good idea, it should be done by someone who is trustful & knowledgeable how to fund it. Would u trust Warren with that policy? I wouldnt. But I trust Yang bec he had been planning on this for several years w other UBI advocates.Tweet@4564e44b
